# Maruti_Suzuki-Case-Analysis-WebScrapping

Summary of the Notebook

Purpose:
The notebook is focused on data extraction and preprocessing — it collects raw data, cleans it, and organizes it into a usable format for later analysis or modeling.

Data Loading:
Imports libraries like pandas, numpy, or others.
Loads raw data from a CSV, Excel, or database source into a DataFrame.

Data Cleaning:
Removes missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
Renames columns for readability.
Converts data types (e.g., strings → numbers, dates).
Standardizes values (e.g., currency symbols, text formatting).

Data Transformation:

Creates new columns or features (like numeric versions of text columns).
Filters rows based on conditions.
Groups or aggregates data if needed.
Exploratory Steps (if included):
Prints summaries or head of the dataset.
May use visualization (matplotlib/seaborn/plotly) to preview patterns.

Output / Saving:
The cleaned and processed data is usually exported (to a CSV or other format) for future analysis or modeling.

In short:
➡️ Raw Data → Cleaned → Structured → Ready for Analysis
